# 2024-SRC-Summer-Program
This repository contains the source code and materials from my two-day lecture series on the 'Thermal phase transition of the Ising model' and 'Training AI for optimal protocols in the Ising model'. I have developed the content and led the lectures, providing both theoretical and practical insights into these topics.

## Day 1: Thermal Phase Transition of the Ising Model
On the first day, we focused on the thermal phase transition of the 2D Ising model. The lecture covered:

- **Introduction to the Ising Model:** Basic concepts and the significance of studying the Ising model in statistical mechanics.
- **Simulation of the 2D Ising Model:** Code for simulating the 2D Ising model using Monte Carlo methods.
- **Phases and Phase Transition:** Identification of various phases and understanding phase transitions.
- **Spinodal Decomposition and Nucleation:** Detailed examination of spinodal decomposition and nucleation processes in the Ising model.

## Day 2: Training AI for Optimal Protocols in the Ising Model
  
On the second day, the focus expanded to leveraging both AI and computational methods, as well as analytic approaches for finding optimal protocols:

- **Analytic Approaches:** Introduction to analytic approaches for finding optimal protocols, based on the following papers:

Rotskoff, Grant M., and Gavin E. Crooks. "Optimal control in nonequilibrium systems: Dynamic Riemannian geometry of the Ising model." Physical Review E 92.6 (2015): 060102.


Sivak, David A., and Gavin E. Crooks. "Thermodynamic metrics and optimal paths." Physical Review Letters 108.19 (2012): 190602.

- **AI in the Ising Model:** Training AI to determine optimal protocols in the 2D Ising model, with reference to the following paper:

Whitelam, Stephen. "Demon in the machine: learning to extract work and absorb entropy from fluctuating nanosystems." Physical Review X 13.2 (2023): 021005.

- **Optimal Path Finding (TSP Problem):** Explanation and demonstration of finding the optimal path in VLSI data using genetic algorithms.

## Purpose
The purpose of these simulations and lectures is to give students a deeper understanding of phase transitions in statistical mechanics and how a combination of computational techniques, including AI, and analytic approaches can be utilized to solve complex problems and optimize protocols in physical systems.

# 2024-SRC-Summer-Program
This repository contains the source code and materials from my two-day lecture series on the 'Thermal phase transition of the Ising model' and 'Training AI for optimal protocols in the Ising model'. I have developed the content and led the lectures, providing both theoretical and practical insights into these topics.

## Day 1: Thermal Phase Transition of the Ising Model
On the first day, we focused on the thermal phase transition of the 2D Ising model. The lecture covered:

- Introduction to the Ising Model: Basic concepts and the significance of studying the Ising model in statistical mechanics.
- Simulation of the 2D Ising Model: Code for simulating the 2D Ising model using Monte Carlo methods.
- Phases and Phase Transition: Identification of various phases and understanding phase transitions.
- Spinodal Decomposition and Nucleation: Detailed examination of spinodal decomposition and nucleation processes in the Ising model.
